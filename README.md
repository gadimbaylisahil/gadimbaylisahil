### Hi there, I am Sahil ðŸ‘‹

I like writing software. It also happens to be my job. These days I am working on:

- Remote consulting & enginnering @[lightfulweb](https://www.lightfulweb.com)

- Building payment APIs and services with @[betterpayment](https://www.betterpayment.de)

- Blogging about day to day tech challanges on @[ramblingcode](https://www.ramblingcode.dev)

- I love open source and try to contribute to projects I use. If you have an interesting project that happens to use
  Rails/Ruby/Javascript, hit me up if you want to collaborate.
  
You can find me on my [website](https://www.sahilgadimbayli.com) or contact me contact[at]sahilgadimbayli.com
