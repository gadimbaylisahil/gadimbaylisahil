### Hi there, I am Sahil ðŸ‘‹

I like writing software and it also happens to be my job. These days I am working on:

- Remote consulting and engineering SME businesses at [lightfulweb](https://www.lightfulweb.com)

- Building payment APIs & services with [betterpayment](https://www.betterpayment.de)

- Blogging about day to day tech challanges on [ramblingcode](https://www.ramblingcode.dev)

- Scrathing a [dev diary](https://devdocs.ramblingcode.dev)

I love open source, minimalistic tools, linux and lots of Ruby. If you have an issue with an existing product or a request for a greenfield project, hit me up for collaboration.
  
You can find me on my [website](https://www.sahilgadimbayli.com) or contact me at contact[at]sahilgadimbayli.com
